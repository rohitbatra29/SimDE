# Simulate and Visualize Verbal Theories as Differential Equations

SimDE (link: https://simde.ucdavis.edu/) is an open-source R Shiny web application that simulates and visualizes univariate and bivariate systems of differential equations. This repository contains all the source code of the application and can be used to locally run the app. The tutorial paper is available at https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/sh4e7_v2.
